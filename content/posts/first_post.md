# Welcome

### This is the new site!

I know I know it aint up to scratch and is very basic but the point is that it looks good and that it works. Not only that it is also now built with zola instead of hugo, there no reason for the decision, I was simply very bored.

### WIP

get a codeberg account lul

Get a better URL lol

Anyway, thats all for this new website brought to you by Zola and the halve-z zola theme, take a look around enjoy the view.

also thanks welpo for figuring out what was wrong
